test for QA role

-----------------------------------------
TEST

Here is a brief testing for you! This is a role for test automation.

I) You need to choose any language and any automation framework to create a script which runs, in a BDD approach, the following test.

1. Open the https://www.mytime.com/consumers page
2 . Search for “haircut” in “San Francisco, CA”
3. Verify that multiple results are shown - at least 3
4. Open any business which appear

On the next screen :
6. Select "All services" in the services filter from the left panel
7. Select second staff from the staff filter in the left side panel
8. Click the “Book” button for the “Men's Haircut” service
9. Press "Select Time" in the add-on modal opened
10. Verify that the user is presented with a list of available time slots with at least 2 entries
11. Verify in the right side panel :
a) Service displayed is the one selected in the step before
b) Service price is the same as the one displayed in the step before
c) Staff selected is the staff chosen before


II) Now, you need to create a test plan in the format you want to test all scenarios about the specified role. Remember that a test plan is a solid concept in Quality Assurance and, although you could choose the format to present it, you need to maintain and pass us all the required information.

Use the following sites as resources:
- Guru99
- YouTube (search for Cypress)
- StackOverflow
- Cypress.io

Common automation tools are:
- Selenium WebDriver with Python, Java
- Cypress, WebDriver.io (what do you think to integrate docker, and Cucumber?)

IDEs: I strongly suggest you to use Visual Studio Code
Operational System: I strongly suggest you to use Linux or MacOS
